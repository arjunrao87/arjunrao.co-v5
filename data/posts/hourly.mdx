## What is Hourly?

If you don't currently have an hourly rate you have set for yourself, you need a way to decide if you should do something on your own, or if you should outsource it to someone else. This is extremely important as it's a way to help you respect and prioritize your own time.

For exactly this reason, I built an app called "Hourly" (available [here](https://usehourly.netlify.app/)) to help you make that decision.

## Why did I build this?

One of Naval's tweets stuck with me more than many of his others. It quantified what I have long believed in terms of balancing the pros and cons of doing something yourself instead of asking someone else to do it for you.

> Set and enforce an aspirational hourly rate.<br/><br/>If fixing a problem will save less than your rate, ignore it.If outsourcing a task will cost less than your rate, outsource it.Get comfortable disappointing people whose expectations will eat your life up, one hour at a time.

## How does Hourly work?

A simple rule of thumb is that if a task is easy and is comparable in price, (between what it would cost you based on your hourly rate vs what it would cost you to pay a professional), you should just do it yourself.

On the other hand, if a task is difficult and your cost is less than 10x what you would pay the professional - thats right, 10x, then you should just give it to the professional to take care of.

Why 10x? This is a rough ["Order of magnitude"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude) rule of thumb that I use for myself, and is certainly up to your own discretion. My mental model is it is 5 parts for all the tools a professional has that is required for the job, 3 parts the skill and efficiency that person has based on the their years of experience and 2 parts the lack of stress for not having to do the job yourself.

_Hourly doesn't track or store any of your data. All the data is processed client side, so your data is yours alone!_
